# IS Helpers & Sitemap Example
This repo contains examples of sitemaps used for client demos and number of helpers (evgHelpers), designed to simplify data collection for demo and enablement purposes.

My examples do not make heavy use of CashDom, which you will find referenced in many official examples of IS code. For more on best practices, see [this page.](https://developer.evergage.com/web-integration/sitemap/sitemap-data-capture)
 
## Setup

Just add this code to your sitemaps as required!
